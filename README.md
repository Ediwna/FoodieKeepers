App that allows restaurants, hypermarkets...to sell their food leftovers of the day at a cheaper price to customer in order to avoid food wasting.

## Introduction
As our society is getting more concerned about inequalities, we are suggesting a way to end bad alimentation. Because of bad financial situation, a lot of people have to skip meals or use cheap junk food. To answer this issue, our project aims on giving cheap but better food to these people. Furthermore, our solution is ecological and avoid the food to go to waste. Our project is an app that links the restaurant’s owners with customers with financial issues. Our app will inform its users when a restaurant nearby has food leftovers. Index Terms—Food, Online service, Application
