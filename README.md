## I Introduction
### A. Abstract
As our society is getting more concerned about inequalities, we are suggesting a way to end bad alimentation. Because of bad financial situation, a lot of people have to skip meals or use cheap junk food. To answer this issue, our project aims on giving cheap but better food to these people. Furthermore, our solution is ecological and avoid the food to go to waste. Our project is an app that links the restaurant’s owners with customers with financial issues. Our app will inform its users when a restaurant nearby has food leftovers. Index Terms—Food, Online service, Application  <br>

### B. Motivation
The unfinished meals after a grand party or activity, the food that cannot be sold in restaurants and snack stalls every day, or the goods to be eliminated after the supermarket’s daily inventory are mainly still edible and intact food, but have to be discarded as garbage. Accorded to the United Nations, one third of the world’s food is discarded, and the main cause of waste is expired or poorly sold goods from large supermarkets all over the world. Discarded food is certainly a loss, but for businesses, it is the choice to maximize benefits to quickly empty inventory and quickly replace foods. In this world of hyper-consumption, we wanted to give a slight inflection, a small deviation just above the minimum to perhaps participate in a change of our ways of thinking. Let's use this opportunity of premature waste in our nearest shops to introduce a new system of social sharing.

### C. Research on any related software
[Olio](https://olioex.com/) Olio is a mobile app for food-sharing, aiming to reduce food waste. It does this by connecting those with surplus food to those who need or wish to consume such food. The food must be edible; it can be raw or cooked, sealed or open. <br>
[Too good to go](https://toogoodtogo.org/en) Too Good To Go is a mobile application that connects customers to restaurants and stores that have unsold food surplus. <br>
[Phenix](https://phenixbyonthelist.com/zh/) Phenix mobile app gives you the chance to put an end to food waste and buy food at a discounted price from our trusted partners. <br>
[No food waste](https://nofoodwaste.org/)No Food Waste is a movement turned NGO started by Padmanaban Gopalan and his friends Dinesh manickam and Sudhakar Mohan to get rid of the problem of hunger. <br>
